Bank Customer Churn Detection
Overview
This repository contains a dataset and code for a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn in a bank. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using the services of a business or company.

Dataset
The dataset (bank_customer_churn.csv) includes the following columns:

RowNumber: A unique identifier for each customer record.
CustomerId: A unique identifier for each customer.
Surname: The surname of the customer.
CreditScore: The credit score of the customer.
Geography: The country where the customer is located.
Gender: The gender of the customer.
Age: The age of the customer.
Tenure: The number of years the customer has been with the bank.
Balance: The account balance of the customer.
NumOfProducts: The number of bank products the customer uses.
HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 for yes, 0 for no).
IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member (1 for yes, 0 for no).
EstimatedSalary: The estimated salary of the customer.
Exited: Whether the customer has churned (1 for yes, 0 for no).
Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn. By proactively identifying these customers, the bank can take targeted actions to retain them, ultimately reducing customer attrition.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes tasks like data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling imbalanced classes.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides insights into the dataset and helps identify patterns.
Model Building: Utilizes various machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model.
Model Evaluation: Assesses the performance of the model using relevant metrics.
